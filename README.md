# TOKE---TheJuthAppHackathon

Developed a small prototype in 48h which in-
cluded a new feature to be implemented in
the Vodafoneâ€™s youth oriented app (Juth). The
feature consists of a virtual High 5 users could
give to each other in order to gain points and
win monthly prices. The goal of the feature
was to strengthen the sense of the commu-
nity between young customers. I used Flutter,
NodeJs and geolocation api to implement the
prototype.
